```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Create a variable of your API key
api_key <- "546E5DUZ2R228YPVP"

# Store the name of your band in a variable
band <- "Alabama Shakes"

# Creat another variable that replaces your spaces with +'s (hint: gsub)
band_no_spaces <- gsub(" ", "+", band)

# Write a query to get the first biography of your band on echonest
# See: http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/artist.html#biographies

bio_text <- bio$response$biographies$text


# Use the fromJSON command to retrieve your data, and store the text of the first biography in a variable
results_bio <- fromJSON(biography_url)

# Run another query to get band images: see: http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/artist.html#images
### Warning: you may get an error message if the image is not available -- check online that it exists!
image_base <- 'http://developer.echonest.com/api/v4/artist/images?api_key='
image_url <- paste0(image_base, api_key, '&name=', band_no_spaces, '&results=1')

image_to_include <- image_results$response$images$url

# Use the fromJSON command to retrieve your data, and store the url of the first image in a variable
results_image <- fromJSON(image_url)

# Outside of this code section, write the (R)Markdown syntax that:
# - States the name of your band
# - Displays the bio you just retrieved 
# - Shows the image of your band

### Bonus ###
# Make another request, and retrieve/display the band's top songs
# Wrap the above steps in a function that takes a band as a parameter, and returns the desired info
